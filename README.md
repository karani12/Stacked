# Stacked

## What is Stacked?
Stacked is more of a guide than a platform. It aims to pool resources from various content creators and provide a central or focal point for resources for self paced developers or anyone resource in the technology industry.

## What was source of the idea?
Well I learnt web development by myself without knowing that guides such as free code camp existed. Stacked aims to compliment such organisations and many others. Pointing towards resources like mdn docs or free code camp.

## Then I should google or?
Well, you can google but what I aim to do is collect links from various content creators. From something as simple as a Twitter thread to tutorials on youtube. Anything that is provided on the internet for free. Helpful Github repositories

## Is it paid?
No, I wanted to fix a problem that I saw existed. Many people, especially where i come from may lack the capacity to buy courses. Bootcamps provide a sense of direction but even for $20 some can't afford it. The sure thing is that these resources exist somewhere on the internet but no central point to collect or know about them. I find twitter threads quite informative and maybe one would find them informative if they found them in a central point.

## The aim?

Well, to pool resources that are free. A book, a twitter thread, a YouTube tutorial or any form of resource that would provide a certain input to someone who can at least access the internet

# How it works
-  user logs in and is authenticated
-  user is granted permission to stack resources and a profile page where their bookmarked resources are and also what they have contributed
-  Unauthenticated users can access the feed page
-  Authenticated users can post and share resources that they have found to be reallly helpful
